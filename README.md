# Music_Player
Mp3-audio player based in python.
Features:-
The main objective of this project is to allow users to play MP3 and digital audio files. To be
engaging for users, the application has to have a simple but beautiful user interface.
-You can have an interface for listing the available MP3 files. You can also give users the option
to list other digital audio files that are not MP3.
-The users will also expect the MP3 Player to have an interface that shows information on the
file that is playing. Some of the information you can include are the name of the file, its length,
the amount played, and the amount not played, in minutes and seconds.
-Python has libraries that can play audio files, such as pygame, which allows you to work with
multimedia files in a few lines of code. You can also check out pymedia and simple audio.These
libraries can handle a lot of digital audio files. They can handle other file types, not just the MP3
files.
